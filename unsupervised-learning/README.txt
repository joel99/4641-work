Download links for datasets and notebooks:
	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nZmFyhJtbgwyIYUbg3ptJKEAw0L2QvKk

From root of dir:
- Move and unzip dataset zip into data/
- Keep notebooks at root level
- Start any Jupyter notebook with sklearn, pyplot, and numpy
- Run through models_diabetes.ipynb to generate graphs for diabetes dataset, or run through models_heart_disease.ipynb to generate graphs for heart disease dataset.

Note that the analysis only shows a subset of the generated plots, for sake of brevity.
