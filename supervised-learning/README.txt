Instructions for running code:

Download links for datasets and notebooks:
	https://drive.google.com/open?id=1nZmFyhJtbgwyIYUbg3ptJKEAw0L2QvKk

From root of dir:
- Move and unzip dataset zip into data/
- Keep notebooks at root level
- Start any Jupyter notebook with sklearn, pyplot, and numpy
- Run through models_diabetes.ipynb to generate graphs for diabetes dataset, or run through models_heart_disease.ipynb to generate graphs for heart disease dataset.

Note that the analysis only shows a subset of the generated plots, for sake of brevity. Additionally, learning curve plots referenced in individual analysis do not have variance reducing parameters used in overall summary, to isolate the effects of train size (generally found to be none).
